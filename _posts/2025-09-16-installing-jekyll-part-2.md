Now it was time to put this on the internet somewhere.

## Github

Uploading the site to Github was simple, as the `.gitignore` file was already configured properly, only needing a line for the `.vscode` folder to be added.

The repository is at [oryant/oryan-uk-jekyll](https://github.com/oryant/oryan-uk-jekyll).

## Github Pages and Github Actions

The next step was to create a Github Pages site for the blog. Since the `_site` folder is not part of the repository, this needs to be generated dynamically using Github Actions.

It seemed logical to follow the [Github Actions](https://ashmaroli.github.io/jekyll/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) tutorial from the Jekyll site. This was okay at first, but I soon found that the Jekyll Actions link to the Github marketplace was dead. I decided to use the search tool in Github, and figured that the action called **GitHub Pages Jekyll** should work well enough.

Not knowing what most of the file meant, I left in untouched. I assume some stuff is being read from the site's config.yml file but actually the whole process is fairly opaque, which isn't my favourite.

I encountered an error message the first time this ran, because I hadn't set up Github Pages yet. Having to go to Settings in the repository to configure Pages seems like a weird choice, but I've done it before so I didn't have any trouble setting this up.

My blog is now live at [Github Pages](https://oryant.github.io/oryan-uk-jekyll).

## Fixing errors

I noticed that I was getting a warning message when deploying the site to Github Pages:


> build
> 
> The github-pages gem can't satisfy your Gemfile's dependencies. If you want to use a different Jekyll version or need additional dependencies, consider building Jekyll site with GitHub Actions: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/


This took me back to a different version of the Jekyll instructions from the ones I had been following. This page suggested I should be using the **Jekyll** workflow, not the **GitHub Pages Jekyll** one I had been using. Since it was early days I figured I might as well try again with this other workflow.

The process of removing one workflow and adding another was fiddly, and every change would result in a push to the main branch, kicking off one or both of the workflows and generating errors. Eventually I got it working, and, after editing the workflow to force a later version of Ruby to be used, the site is back up and running.

Overall, the experience of setting this up was a bit frustrating due to slightly old documentation, but that's to be expected from something a) free and b) aimed at computer people.
